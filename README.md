### Java Code Execution Note

Some of the Java codes require execution via the command prompt or terminal using the `javac` (Java compiler) and `java` commands. Make sure to compile your Java files with:

```sh
javac FileName.java
```

and then run them using:

```sh
java FileName
```

Replace `FileName` with the actual name of your Java class (without the `.java` extension).

## Java OOP Viva Voce Questions (With Answers) - _Just an Assumption_

‚ÑπÔ∏è Ai Info

This section contains potential viva voce questions with answers, covering **general OOP concepts** and **file-specific implementations**.

---

### üìö General OOP Concepts

#### 1. Core Principles  
**Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**  
 A paradigm that organizes software design around "objects" containing data (attributes) and behavior (methods), emphasizing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  

**Q2. Why use private variables with public getters/setters?**  
 To enforce encapsulation‚Äîprotecting data integrity by controlling access (e.g., validation in setters) while hiding implementation details.  

**Q3. Give a real-world example of polymorphism.**  
 `Payment` interface with `processPayment()` method implemented differently by `CreditCard`, `UPI`, and `Cash` classes.  

**Q4. How is abstraction different from encapsulation?**  
 Abstraction hides complexity by showing only essentials (e.g., interfaces), while encapsulation bundles data and methods while restricting access.

### üíª File-Specific Q&A

#### üîç `Code1_Debugging.java`  
**Q1. What does this program do?**  
 Demonstrates debugging techniques for logical errors (e.g., incorrect loop conditions or variable assignments).  

**Q2. How would you debug an infinite loop here?**  
 Use breakpoints in IDE, print statements, or step-through debugging to inspect loop variables and termination conditions.  

**Q3. What‚Äôs the purpose of `System.out.println` in debugging?**  
 To trace program flow and inspect variable values at runtime (though IDE debuggers are more efficient).  

**Q4. Name two Java debugging tools.**  
 Eclipse/IntelliJ debugger and `jdb` (Java Debugger command-line tool).  

#### üõ°Ô∏è `Code2_Encapsulation.java`  
**Q1. Why are variables `private` here?**  
 To prevent direct external modification, ensuring data is only changed via controlled methods (e.g., setters with validation).  

**Q2. Can a getter return a mutable object? What‚Äôs the risk?**  
 Yes, but it risks breaking encapsulation if the returned object‚Äôs state is modified externally. Defensive copying (e.g., `return new ArrayList<>(list)`) solves this.  

**Q3. What happens if a setter doesn‚Äôt validate input?**  
 Invalid data (e.g., negative age) can corrupt object state, violating encapsulation.  

**Q4. How would you make a read-only class?**  
 Declare variables `private final` and provide only getters (no setters).  

#### üß¨ `Code3_Single_Inheritance.java`  
**Q1. What‚Äôs the output of `Dog` class?**  
 Inherits `eat()` from `Animal` and overrides `bark()`, so calling `dog.eat()` prints "Animal eats" and `dog.bark()` prints "Dog barks".  

**Q2. What if `Animal.eat()` were `private`?**  
 Compilation error‚Äîprivate methods are not inherited.  

**Q3. Can `Dog` override `Animal`‚Äôs `static` method?**  
 No, static methods are hidden, not overridden (compile-time polymorphism).  

**Q4. How is `super` keyword used here?**  
 To call parent class methods/constructors (e.g., `super.eat()` in `Dog`).  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è `Code6_MethodOverloading.java`  
**Q1. How does Java choose which overloaded method to call?**  
 Based on compile-time method signature (number/type/order of arguments).  

**Q2. Can overloaded methods have different return types?**  
 Only if parameter lists differ‚Äîreturn type alone doesn‚Äôt distinguish overloads.  

**Q3. What‚Äôs method overloading‚Äôs compile-time name?**  
 Static polymorphism (resolved during compilation).  

**Q4. Why can‚Äôt `int sum(int a, int b)` and `long sum(int a, int b)` coexist?**  
 Same parameter types; return types don‚Äôt differentiate overloads.

### üñ•Ô∏è GUI & Swing (`Code9_SwingComponents.java`)  
**Q1. What‚Äôs the role of `ActionListener`?**  
 Interface for handling button-click events via `actionPerformed()` method.  

**Q2. How would you add a tooltip to the button?**  
 `button.setToolTipText("Click me!")`.  

**Q3. Why use `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()`?**  
 Ensures GUI updates happen on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) for thread safety.  

**Q4. What‚Äôs the difference between `JFrame` and `JPanel`?**  
 `JFrame` is a top-level window, while `JPanel` is a container for organizing components within a frame.
